abstract={This paper describes the use of vector space decomposition for development of a simplified model of a nine phase synchronous machine. It is shown that the nine phase machine can be reduced to the usual d-q equivalent circuit model plus seven additional circuits to represent zero sequence components. These additional components are shown to provide additional current paths for both zero sequence components as well as negative sequence components.},
