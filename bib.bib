	general performance due to the widespread use of motor-drive systems
	in numerous critical applications. Therefore, strategies able to
	operate under faulty conditions are of extreme importance. However,
	for them to operate there is the obvious need of detecting, identifying

	to the drive. The active rectifier also improves the drive fault

	Finite element analysis of the motor is carried out to obtain output

	with minimum torque ripple and least stator ohmic loss. Furthermore,

	fluctuates considerably during the fault condition. To solve this
	problem, a constraint to make the summation of the phase currents
	to zero is incorporated in the derivation of the fault tolerant optimal

	the function of the integrated and distributed inverter. The distribution

	Each inverter module is placed evenly around the end of the stator

	is the most important. Therefore, this paper further proposes to
	operate just one motor to provide the total required torque in the
	low torque region. A clutch may be employed between one motor and
	gearbox (differential), thus “switching off” its idle loss (no-load
	loss, flux-weakening loss), and improving the drive train efficiency.
	An online optimized torque distribution algorithm has been devised
	based on the motor efficiency map to determine whether the second
	motor should be disengaged by the clutch in the low torque region.
	With the proposed optimization scheme, the drive train efficiency
	can be improved by 4% over the NEDC cycle. Experimental test results
